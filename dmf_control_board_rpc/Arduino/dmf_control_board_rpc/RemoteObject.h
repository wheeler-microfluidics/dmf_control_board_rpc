/**
RemoteObject:

This class implements a simple communication protocol between a PC and
Arduino over an RS-232 link using HDLC-like framing. It uses a wrapper
for the boost asio library (SimpleSerial) that provides an interface that
closely matches the Serial library on the Arduino. This allows sharing
of the bulk of the code between the PC (Windows, Linux or Mac) and the
Arduino. This implementation was partly inspired by Alvaro Lopes' serpro
project:

  https://github.com/alvieboy/arduino-serpro

Each packet has the following structure:

<pre>
+------------+---------+----------------+---------+------------+----------+
| Start Flag | Command | Payload Length | Payload |    CRC     | End Flag |
|   1 byte   | 1 byte  |    1-2 bytes   | N bytes |  2 bytes   |  1 byte  |
|    0x7E    |         |                |         | (optional) |   0x7E   |
+------------+---------+----------------+---------+------------+----------+
</pre>

Commands are uint8_t and should have the MSB=1 (replies have MSB=0). The
RemoteObject base class reserves the commands 0x80 to 0x9F, while derived
classes should restrict themselves to commands in the range 0xA0 to 0xFF.

The payload length can be one or two bytes.  If the payload is less than 128
bytes, it's length is expressed as a single byte.  If the most-significant
bit is set, the length is expressed as two bytes and can be recovered by
clearing the most significant byte (i.e. PAYLOAD_LENGTH & 0x7FFF).

<b>Examples:</b>
   - payload length of 3, one byte: 0x04
   - payload length of 512, two bytes: 0x82 0x01

Total packet length (not including flags) = Header Length (2-3 bytes)
                                            + Payload Length
                                            (+ 2 if CRC is enabled)

To use this class, you must derive a class based on it and reimplement the
virtual member function process_command().
